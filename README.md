- 👋 Hello , I have being in a profissional transition ( to the tech field since 2019).
- 👀 I’m interested in Exchange experiences  with  the most huge number of different cultures, this would bring us a little bit of DATA , and\or Statistics <<<  and sure Empathy >>> ℹ
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PYTHON and SQL. For data analysing (and B.i.).
 ### - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of projects, and Team management of risks. And Studying for a CAPM Certification. ###
#### - 📫 How to reach me : **(cebraecologica@gmail.com)** >>> *>BY HEART<*  because by the stomach its too easy ( and i'm a 12+ years professional Chef of Cuisine SO i love :YUMMY: things ) ####
- (cebraecologica@gmail.com) <<< (cebraecologica@gmail.com) >>>
- 😄 Pronouns: "Delicious" ( for the food), "Chubby", "Fatty", "Bald", "Blondy", "Hey Ceará!", "Gostosão", "caba bom forrozeiro", 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love being with people,  but at the same time I love to play 3:00 minutes chess matches ... alone ( i Mean, ONLINE).
- 

--- I'm Kidding, but even online chess, against other players, is better than LOL or DOTA 
#MAY the games begin!!!
